# Supermarket Sales Analysis and Business Intelligence

This project focuses on analyzing supermarket sales data using various Business Intelligence (BI) techniques and tools. It demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, visualization using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and data analysis in Tableau and PowerBI.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to process and visualize the sales data of supermarket stores. The data consists of store attributes such as sales, area, number of customers, and available items. The project includes:

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Extracting and transforming the raw data to derive useful insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Python (Matplotlib, Plotly) and BI tools like Tableau and PowerBI to visualize the data.
- **KPIs Calculation**: Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales per customer, sales per square meter, etc.
